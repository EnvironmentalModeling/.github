# Environmental Modeling Team

The Environmental Modeling Team is an interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers led by the Environmental Laboratory, Engineer Research and Development Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Our primary focus is developing and applying advanced modeling tools and frameworks to simulate hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes in aquatic systems. We support informed decision-making for water resource management, ecosystem restoration, and sustainable development through quantitative analysis and predictive modeling.

Aquatic ecosystems and the communities that depend on them face increasing threats from hydrological and climate extremes, development pressures, harmful algal blooms, and water quality degradation. Our modeling approaches integrate physical, chemical, and biological processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales to help achieve the dynamic balance needed to protect and restore these systems.

## Guiding Principles

Our work is structured around three interconnected components that guide model development and application:

### Hydrological Framework
Quantification of hydrodynamic processes provides the physical template upon which water quality and ecological simulations are built. This includes characterizing water movement, thermal dynamics, stratification patterns, and transport processes. Understanding the hydrological framework is essential for accurate simulation of constituent fate and transport.

### Ecological and Water Quality Targets
Simulation of biogeochemical cycles and ecological processes enables prediction of water quality conditions and ecosystem responses. This component addresses nutrient dynamics, dissolved oxygen, algal growth (including harmful algal blooms), and other indicators of ecosystem health and resilience.

### Modeling and Analysis Methods
Integration of hydrodynamic frameworks with ecological and water quality targets through numerical modeling provides tools for Integrated Water Resource Management. These methods support evaluation of management alternatives including reservoir operations, environmental pool management, selective withdrawal strategies, and nature-based solutions.

## Core Considerations

Our modeling approaches consider:

- **Flow paths and transport**: Movement of water and constituents through watersheds and receiving waters
- **Residence time**: Relationships between inflow, outflow, storage, and the time available for biogeochemical transformations
- **Biogeochemical reactions**: Processes that transform nutrients, regulate dissolved oxygen, drive primary production, and influence water quality
- **System connectivity**: Interactions among hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry, as well as linkages between upstream sources and downstream receiving waters

## Tools and Frameworks

### CE-QUAL-W2
A two-dimensional, longitudinal-vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model for rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries. CE-QUAL-W2 simulates water surface elevations, velocities, temperatures, and user-defined water quality constituents including nutrients, algae, dissolved oxygen, and organic matter.

### ClearWater
A modular water quality modeling system designed for flexibility and integration with diverse hydrodynamic platforms. ClearWater includes ClearWater-Riverine for one-dimensional riverine applications and supports simulation of nutrient cycling, algal dynamics, and other biogeochemical processes.

### NADI
The Network Analysis and Data Integration framework automates hydrological data retrieval, network analysis, and preprocessing for water quality modeling applications. NADI streamlines workflows for assembling model inputs from distributed data sources.

### Environmental Pool Management Tools
Screening and analysis tools for evaluating reservoir operational strategies that balance flood risk management, water supply, and environmental objectives through optimized pool level management and selective withdrawal.
